## Overview

This collection of Python code snippets provides functionality for handling names, processing word counts from a text file, and converting heights between inches and centimeters. Each code block serves a specific purpose and can be utilized independently.

## Code 1: Name Processor

### Description

The first code block processes user-inputted first and last names, concatenates them into a full name, and then generates an alternative string by selecting every second character.

### Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Input your first and last names when prompted.
3. The full name and the alternative string will be printed.

## Code 2: Word Counter

### Description

The second code block reads a text file, counts the occurrences of each word in each line, and outputs the results to both the console and an 'output.txt' file.

### Usage

1. Create a text file named 'input.txt' with the desired content.
2. Run the script.
3. The word counts for each line will be printed on the console and saved to 'output.txt'.

## Code 3: Height Converter - Interactive Loop

### Description

The third code block prompts the user to input the number of customers and their heights in inches. It then converts these heights to centimeters and prints the results.

### Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Input the number of customers.
3. Input the height in inches for each customer.
4. The converted heights in centimeters will be printed.

## Code 4: Height Converter - List Comprehension
